      <p>
        Iâ€™m a web developer and data analyst with hands-on experience in
        building applications and analyzing data flows.
         <br></br>
         My work involves using
        the Ab Initio tool for data processing and integration, along with
        scripting in shell to automate tasks and streamline processes. I focus
        on creating efficient, reliable solutions tailored to project needs.
